## Abstract

These are a set of notes designed for a short course addressing the use of the Julia Programming Language for High Performance Computing (HPC). They target the reader
that has some basic knowledge of HPC and distributed systems. First goal is to show
how to use Julia from zero on a typical HPC cluster environment. Second goal is showing which changes are necessary for parallelizing a code using Julia. The main purpose
of the use of Julia is that it is easy to install, easy to code, and it can still deliver great
computational performance on a HPC system.
